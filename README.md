# PyCascades at PIK

This repository includes my efforts at working with the PyCascades model for my Erasmus Traineeship at Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.
Supervisors: Nico Wunderling and Ann Kristin Klose.

The environment needed to run the pycascades model can be downloaded by the following command: conda env create -f environment.yml
